# 👋 Hi there, I’m @Carbinski

🎓 I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student with a passion for building useful, user-friendly software.

📱 Most recently, I’ve been working on **The BUKU App**, a Swift-based iOS marketplace tailored for college students. I’ve been developing both the frontend in **SwiftUI** and the backend using **Firebase**, focusing on region-based listings and smooth user experiences.

💡 I enjoy working on projects that blend practical utility with thoughtful design. Whether it's mobile apps, backend systems, or scripting tools, I’m always looking to grow as an engineer and collaborator.

🧠 Currently exploring:
- Facial Recognition
- iOS development with **SwiftUI**
- Real-time databases and **Firebase** integration
- Leetcode 💀💀💀
- Open-source contributions & hackathons
